## Basic Gulp Workflow

1. Clone the repo
2. Install 'gulp' globally
3. cd into the repo and run 'npm install'
4. Generate your own key.pem and cert.pem using openSSL 
4. Run the command 'gulp' from the command line
5. Run the command 'npm start' from another terminal

## Adding to the code

As long as it is running, Gulp will automatically concatenate and obfuscate any javascript files that are inside of the 'js' folder.


# TODO

1. <s>Detect the context of the page and change the UI / functionality
accordingly.</s>
2. On the TFS page, show a drop down selector of the most common
bugs. The bugs can be selected from the drop down and the fields
will automatically be populated.
3. On the TFS page, create a "copy bug" function. This will grab
the essential fields from the bug and allow them to be stored
somewhere else.
4. Detect the context of the page and change the HOTKEYS accordingly
