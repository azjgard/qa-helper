## Basic Gulp Workflow

1. Clone the repo
2. Install 'gulp' globally
3. cd into the repo and run 'npm install'
4. Generate your own key.pem and cert.pem using openSSL 
4. Run the command 'gulp' from the command line
5. Run the command 'npm start' from another terminal

## Adding to the code

As long as it is running, Gulp will automatically concatenate and obfuscate any javascript files that are inside of the 'js' folder.
